# Linubot

**Linubot** is a containerized ROS 2 (Jazzy) differential drive robotics project designed for the Raspberry Pi. It provides real-time motor control via a Bluetooth PS4 controller, interfacing with an L293D motor driver.

To ensure robust deployment on edge devices, the entire ROS 2 workspace, including `joy_node` dependencies and Python hardware libraries, is packaged as a strict-confined Linux Snap.

## 🚀 Features

* **ROS 2 Jazzy Integration:** Utilizes standard `sensor_msgs/Joy` topics for teleoperation.
* **Snapcraft Deployment:** Fully containerized environment ensuring dependency isolation (including SDL/PulseAudio fixes for headless joystick support).
* **Differential Drive Mixing:** Custom Python logic converting raw X/Y joystick axes into normalized left/right PWM motor speeds.
* **Background Daemon:** Configured to automatically launch as a system daemon on boot.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

* **Compute:** Raspberry Pi 4 (or similar SBC running Ubuntu/Debian)
* **Motor Driver:** L293D Dual H-Bridge IC
* **Actuators:** 2x DC Motors (Left and Right)
* **Input:** PlayStation 4 DualShock Controller (Bluetooth)
* **Power:** Independent external battery pack for motor power (VCC2)

### GPIO Pinout (BCM)

| Component | Function | Raspberry Pi GPIO | L293D Pin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Left Motor (A)** | Forward (IN1) | GPIO 5 | Pin 2 |
|  | Backward (IN2) | GPIO 6 | Pin 7 |
|  | Enable PWM (ENA) | GPIO 12 | Pin 1 |
| **Right Motor (B)** | Forward (IN3) | GPIO 23 | Pin 10 |
|  | Backward (IN4) | GPIO 24 | Pin 15 |
|  | Enable PWM (ENB) | GPIO 13 | Pin 9 |

*Note: The L293D ground pins must share a common ground with the Raspberry Pi.*

## 📦 Installation & Building

Since Linubot is packaged as a Snap, you do not need to install ROS 2 natively on your host machine. All dependencies are handled by Snapcraft.

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Diaoko9/Linubot.git
cd Linubot

```


2. **Build the Snap:**
```bash
snapcraft pack

```


3. **Install the built Snap:**
```bash
sudo snap install ./linubot_1.0_arm64.snap --dangerous --devmode

```



## 🎮 Usage

1. **Connect the PS4 Controller:**
Ensure your controller is paired via Bluetooth and registered to the OS at `/dev/input/js0`.
2. **Run the Robot:**
Upon installation, the snap runs automatically as a background daemon. To take manual control or view logs, stop the daemon and run it interactively:
```bash
sudo snap stop linubot
sudo snap run linubot

```


3. **Controls:**
* **Left Joystick (Vertical):** Forward / Backward Throttle
* **Left Joystick (Horizontal):** Left / Right Steering Mixing



## 🛑 Troubleshooting

* **`GPIO busy` Error:** If running manually, ensure the background daemon is stopped (`sudo snap stop linubot`) so it releases the hardware pins.
* **Controller not detected:** If `joy_node` fails to initialize, verify the PS4 controller hasn't gone to sleep and is still mapped to `js0`. You can restart the Bluetooth service via `sudo systemctl restart bluetooth`.
